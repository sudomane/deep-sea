# cl-OCR (Command line OCR)

## What is this project?

This project aims to implement a multi-layer perceptron network in the C programming language, for speed and memory efficiency. Using this network implementation, the goal of this project is to re-create an OCR capable of recognizing hand-written digits with high accuracy, and low compute time.

The network is matrix based, calculations are performed via matrix operations, allowing for easy implementation of feed forward, backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms.

This project is still a work in progress.

## Running the project

* Compile the source code
```
make
```

* Run the binary
